- 👋 Hi, I’m Owain
- 👀 I’m interested in: 
    - books: from fantasy to textbooks and in-between. I always appreciate recommendations. 
        - Some recommendations of my own: 'Philosophy of Physics' (Max Planck, particularly the final 8pgs of Ch1), 'A Very Easy Death' (Simone de Beauvoir), 'We' (Yevgeni Zamyatin)
    - fundamental questions about truth/knowledge/learnability/communication, and philosophy more broadly
    - formal logic, and related applications in philosophy, CS, and math
    - music: see my [last.fm](last.fm/user/owainwest) for data on my historical listening. I always appreciate recommendations. Were it not for covid, I'd frequently be found dancing at basement concerts, a-la-philly-diy-scene. 
    - sports: I played competitive hockey and baseball in a previous life, before dropping that in favor of academics, and still enjoy watching. Go Leafs and Jays. I am good at, and really enjoy, table tennis. 
    - chess: I'm not good at it, but I'm enjoying learning
    - photography: some examples are linked on my [personal site](owainwest.com)
    - history, politics, current events, and social progress: I appreciate any (and *only*) good-faith and respectful conversation about these hot-button issues. I particularly care about both world and national: income and standard-of-living inequality, healthcare accessibility (both mental and physical), education access, open access to information, and more generally the rights and treatment of marginalized groups.
